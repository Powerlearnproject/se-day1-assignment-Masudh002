Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a computer science field focusing in engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
importance: enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life like communication.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
2. the advent of structural programming in the 1970s
3. the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2. Design- creating high level designs  of the Software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation- Writing the real code here according to the design
4. Testing-  Conducting tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment- Releasing the software to the user
6. Maintenance- Providing ongoing support and updates to the software .

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall- Sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards.
Agile- Iterative and incremental approach focused ond flexibility,  collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software  Developer: Writes code and implement software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivering of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- Provides comprehensive tools for writing,  debugging,  and testing code.
VCS- helps in tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements
Tight deadlines
Technical debt
To overcome these challenges, 
Effective communication, 
prioritisation of tasks,
Regular reassessment of project goals and timeliness.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: Testing individual components of software 
Integration: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software software as a whole.
Assurance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
P.E is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
1. Helps the AI to give the best solutions
2. Helps in improving the interaction between humans and AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Explain to me like I am 10 years old what are functions in JavaScript programming language.

Using the words like, " 10 years old" , "Programming language " to show specific information
